A SAT solver to solve a sudoku, inspired by the Project Euler problem 96.
Here, we get a set of 50 sudokus to solve. Some easier, some harder.

For some reason, in sudoku's we typically face a "duality" problem.
The solver is stuck, since there is no more values to be simply eliminated.
However, there are two alternate values to choose, which will cause a cascade
to the rest of the values in the grid. In this sudoku set, 10/50 of
the grids are such that duality problems are faced.

Since the parsing of boolean conditions is a huge effort, a simpler methodology
is provided here. The problem is to be fed an array of conditions that
are by default considered as "and" connected. Within the single statements
we can connect "yes" (y) and "no" (n) format references to the grid of
(tri)boolean values. These are connected using "and" (A) and "or" (V).
